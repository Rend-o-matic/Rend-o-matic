A musical collaboration project for disconnected performers.

[Rend-o-matic](https://rend-o-matic.github.io) is a Call for Code with The Linux Foundation Project [created by developers at IBM](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/passion-projects/choirless). Rend-o-matic is the technology that powers the [Choirless platform](https://www.choirless.com/). 

## What is Rend-o-matic?
Choirless is a musical collaboration platform built to enter the [Call for Code 2020](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/passion-projects/choirless) global competition. It allows music groups to create a video wall recording of a piece of music, where all of the individual submissions are captured separately on the performers' phone, tablet or laptop.

Choirless came about during the 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic, as countries went into lockdown and social-distancing prevented choirs, bands and other musical ensembles from meeting and performing in person. Video meeting platforms such as Zoom and Webex proved useless for live collaboration because of the network latency and the audio being optimised for speech.

Choirless aims to make it very easy for choir leaders to create songs made out of several parts (e.g. alto, tenor, soprano) and to organise choir members to provide renditions of a part. All of the contributed videos are stitched together into a video wall with no special equipment and without employing costly and time-consuming video editing software.

***Rend-o-matic*** is a [Call for CodeÂ® with The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/call-for-code/) project that features a set of core Choirless platform components.
